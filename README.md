## Intro

[The Drovers Cattle Exchange](https://www.cattle-exchange.com/) is a popular website that allows beef and dairy farmers to list cattle for sale. 

The cattle exchange provides marketplaces for dozens of different breeds of cattle and a wealth of other information but does not include a way to download this data into an accessible format. This scrip when run will compile information from the first page of cattle listings for each breed into a txt file. 

You can also check out the [r/cattleexchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/CattleExchange/) subreddit which uses a python based bot to post random listings taken from the cow-bell script.
